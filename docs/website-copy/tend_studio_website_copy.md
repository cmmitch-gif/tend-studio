## Section 4: Who It's For
Background: Cream (#FDF6EE) — slightly different shade or card-style container to create visual separation
Layout: Two-column. Text on left, illustration on right.

**Section heading (forest green):**
Built for brands that think long-term

**Body copy:**
**Some agencies chase short-term revenue** with endless discount codes and flash sales. That's not us.

Tend Studio is for brands that care about the customer relationship — the kind that want people to come back because they love the brand, not because there's 20% off.

We focus on lifetime value, not just the next sale. That means welcome experiences that feel personal, post-purchase emails that build loyalty, and campaigns that sound like your brand — because that's what actually grows a business over time.

# NOTES FOR DESIGN & BUILD

## Voice reminders (from brand guide):
- Warm, not corporate
- Plain language — no jargon
- Contractions always (we're, you'll, it's, don't)
- Australian English (colour, optimise, analyse)
- Sentence case for headings, not Title Case (exception: page titles)
- 🌱 emoji used sparingly — footer, confirmation message, maybe one other place

## Hierarchy:
- Headlines should be confident and clear, not clever
- Subheadings do the explaining
- Body copy is short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Lots of white space

## Colour usage:
- Cream (#FDF6EE) for main backgrounds
- White (#FEFCF9) for card backgrounds
- Forest green (#2D6A4F) for headings and primary buttons
- Terracotta (#C8705A) for accent CTAs, highlights, descriptor text (use sparingly)
- Sage (#74A68D) for borders, secondary elements
- Mint (#B7D7C8) for brand bar background, soft fills
- Charcoal (#2C2C2C) for body text
- Warm grey (#6B6B6B) for secondary text

## Visual tone — softness and rounded elements:
- **Border radius:** Use generous rounding throughout. Cards: 16px–20px. Buttons: 12px–16px (not fully rounded/pill unless it's a tag). Input fields: 10px–12px. Images: 12px–16px.
- **Shadows:** Soft, diffused box shadows on cards — no harsh drop shadows. Think `box-shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)`. Cards should feel like they float gently, not pop off the page. NO neumorphic/inset shadows.
- **Corners:** No sharp 0px corners anywhere on the site. Even containers and sections with background colours should have soft edges or generous padding that creates visual softness.
- **Buttons:** Rounded but not pill-shaped. Generous horizontal padding (24px–32px). Subtle hover transitions (background colour shift, slight lift via shadow).
- **Transitions:** All hover states and interactions should have smooth easing (200–300ms). Nothing abrupt.
- **Spacing:** Generous padding inside cards (24px–32px). Generous section spacing (80px–120px between sections). The site should breathe.
- **Dividers:** Avoid hard lines between sections. Use alternating background colours (cream/white) to create separation instead. If a border is needed, use 1px sage (#74A68D) at low opacity.
- **Overall feel:** The site should feel soft, warm, and unhurried. Like picking up a product with beautiful packaging. Nothing should feel sharp, angular, or clinical.

## Responsive:
- Cards stack vertically on mobile
- Brand bar continues scrolling on mobile
- Form fields full-width on mobile
- Generous touch targets on mobile
- Hero illustration stacks above or below text on mobile
- "How it works" cards stack vertically (no zigzag) on mobile
- Descriptor text in nav hides on mobile
